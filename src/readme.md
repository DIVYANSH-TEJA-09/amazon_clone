# Amazon Clone

# Project Role Definition

As a Frontend Web Developer, your responsibility is to design and implement a high-fidelity Amazon homepage clone using modern web technologies. The solution should be visually appealing, responsive, and interactive, closely mimicking the look and feel of the official Amazon homepage. You are expected to leverage your expertise in JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and best practices in UI/UX to deliver a professional-grade result.

## Requirements
- Use HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for all UI and interactivity.
- Only the homepage is required, but it should include multiple sections (offers, navigation, hero, product grid, and footer).
- Use placeholder images (e.g., via Placehold.it or Lorem Picsum) for products and banners.
- The design must be responsive and accessible.
- The project should be completable within 15-30 minutes for a skilled developer.

## Additional Functionalities to Implement
- Interactive product cards (e.g., quick view modal, wishlist button).
- Dynamic offers carousel/slider at the top.
- Search bar with basic filtering (client-side demo only).
- Responsive navigation menu (hamburger for mobile).
- Sticky navigation bar on scroll.
- Animated add-to-cart feedback.
- Light/dark mode toggle.
- Footer with useful links and newsletter signup.
